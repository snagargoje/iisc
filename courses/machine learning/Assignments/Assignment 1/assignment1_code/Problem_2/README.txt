In this directory, the following files are provided.

 

1. kNN.m - This is the main kNN classifier. Make the modifications within this file. By default, it always return a label 1.
 2. decision_boundary_NN.m - This function plots the decision boundary given the training samples with respect to the kNN classifier.
 3. classification_error.m - This calculates the misclassification error between the predicted labels and the ground truth.
 

4. data_simulated.mat - This is a Matlab .mat file, which contains the following data. You can call load('data_simulated.mat') to access them.
